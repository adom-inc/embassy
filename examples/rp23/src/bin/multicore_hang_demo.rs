//! This example demonstrates a potential bug that I believe is related to the
//! critical section implementation for the RP2350. When using the second core
//! of the processor, behavior is sometimes observed that looks a lot like
//! non-mutually exclusive access to data stored inside a mutex guarded by a
//! critical section. This can manifest itself in a couple of ways including
//! channels hanging on the sender side and DMA Transfer futures hanging. This
//! example uses async SPI to initiate DMA transfers as this seemed to be the
//! most consistent way that I found to cause a hang.
//!
//! When the bug is triggered, core 1 hangs and we detect this by the watchdog
//! timer initiating a chip reset. In this instance we hold the status LED high
//! and then panic to halt.
//!
//! If core 1 does not hang after 2 seconds, we manually trigger a watchdog
//! reset so that we can try again. We do this because I noticed that the bug
//! almost always gets triggered fairly early on in execution and if we survive
//! for more than 2 seconds it is unlikely that we will see it happen.
//!
//! If you couldn't already tell, this behavior is pretty cursed.
//!
//! The watchdog scratch registers are used to persist some metrics between
//! attempts. Registers 0 and 1 are used to hold the core 1 loop counter and
//! register 2 is used to track the number of attempts we've made so far (reboot
//! count).
